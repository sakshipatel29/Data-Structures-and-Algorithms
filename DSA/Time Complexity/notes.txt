time complexity !== time taken to run.

What is Time Complexity:
--> The rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.

Time complexity is written in Big-On Notations ( O() )

Always calculate with 3 rules:

1. Check Worst Case
2. Avoid Constant
3. Avoid lower value

Big 0 --> Worst case --> Upper Bound

Theta 0 --> avg case

Omega 0 --> Lower Bound

Single for loop: O(n)
nested for loop: O(n*n)

we write code , send it to server like,( gfg, lc)
where time complexity is:

1 sec for 10**8 operations
2 sec for 2 * 10**8 operations
3 sec for 3 * 10**8 operations

Space Complexity: --> Memory Space that a program takes.

--> Big O Notations

--> Auxiliary space (the space that you use to solve the problem) + input space ((the space that you use to store the problem))
